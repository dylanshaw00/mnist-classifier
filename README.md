in this notebook we code a simple 2 layer neural network. We train the network on the mnist dataset to classify handwritten digits
In this notbook we code our neural network from scratch with no ML packages such as Tensorflow or Pytorch, in the view to building intuition
on how these models work under the hood. 

We used a simple network with two hidden layers and ten neurons in each layer. In this project we achived an accuracy of 85% on our unseen
data. Some simple changes we could make to our network to impove accuracy would be to increase the number of layers in the network
improve the numerical stability of the softmax function.
